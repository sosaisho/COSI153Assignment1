Name of the app: 

    All4Pets

Elevator Pitch:

    This app is for people who likes looking at cute animal pictures(and video eventually) to get away from the craziness of the day to day lives. Many people including myself follow cute pets accounts on social media such as Instagram so they can look at some cute animals. This app allows those people to be able to look at those contents without distractions of other contents and allow them to share contents among each others(eventually).
